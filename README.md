# WPwp

WPwp is a boilerplate WordPress starter theme, for getting up and running with webpack 4.

## Features

- Sass styling
- Webpack bundling
- Stripped down WordPress

## Todo

Pretty much everything. This is real barebones right now.

## Getting Started

This mostly something I'm putting together for my own purposes, but if you want to check it out here's what you need.

### Requirements

I've done all of my work with the following setup:

- WordPress 4.9.7
- PHP 7.1.7
- Node.js 10.4.1

Feel free to try it with your setup and let me know what doesn't work.

### Installing

Clone the repo, then cd into the directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, run:

```
npm run build
```

Great. You have a working WordPress theme. Deploy this folder to your WordPress wp-content/themes directory and check it out.
